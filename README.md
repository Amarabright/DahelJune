## Introduction

This is an analysis of the Sales performance of AdventureWorksDW. It is done by analyzing data from different schemas on the AdventureWorks DWdatabase. I anlyzed data from dim_customers table, dim_date table, dim_product table, dim_territory sales and fact_internet sales table. I used SQL to query the data from the database and imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out.

**Disclaimer** This is not a real company as we know that adventure works DW database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.
